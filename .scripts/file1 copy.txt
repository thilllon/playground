100. The Right Angle
The woman lies on her back, with her bottom at the edge of the bed or table for the Right Angle sex position. Her partner enters her while caressing her breasts or clitoris. The Right Angle position also works well without thrusting: if the woman grips hold of the man by crossing her ankles behind his back and he presses himself against her, the pressure will mount, giving both partners intense pleasure. This is a very stimulating position if she can squeeze her pelvis floor muscles.
